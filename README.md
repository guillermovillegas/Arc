## Brand

FAINEANT (anglicised; French *fainéant*: idle, at leisure). The mark is always the logo image — never typed text. Visual surface is dark canonical (smoke-900 ground), with a champagne accent. Voice is sensual and slow; CTAs are imperative ("Reserve a window," "Open the door at 14:00"). See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-27-faineant-rebrand-design.md` for the full design spec.

## Testing

```bash
pnpm test              # all packages
pnpm typecheck         # all packages
```
