//   - `yearsExperience` is currently informational only — woven into the bio
//     where appropriate; no schema column exists yet (TODO: add when needed).
//   - Service category enum maps:
//       HAIR -> HAIRCUT, LASH -> LASHES, BARBER -> FADE,
//       FACE -> FACIAL, NAILS -> NAILS, MAKEUP -> MAKEUP.
