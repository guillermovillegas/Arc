### Transactional Email — Resend (Recommended)

**Why Resend:** Modern API, built by ex-Vercel team, first-class React Email support (build templates in JSX/TSX), excellent deliverability, simple DNS setup, works perfectly with Next.js/Node.

| Resend Plan | Cost | Emails/mo | Domains | API Keys | Support |

| **Free** | **$0** | 3,000 (100/day) | 1 | 2 | Community |

#### Email Templates Needed for FAINEANT

| Template | Trigger | Priority |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Email verification | User registers | Phase 1 |
| Welcome email | After verification | Phase 1 |
| Password reset | User requests reset | Phase 1 |
| Booking confirmation (client) | Booking created | Phase 1 |
| Booking confirmation (provider) | New booking received | Phase 1 |

#### Template Implementation with React Email

Resend uses [React Email](https://react.email) — templates are React components:

```
apps/api/src/emails/
  booking-confirmation.tsx
  email-verification.tsx
  password-reset.tsx
  payment-receipt.tsx
  welcome.tsx
```

React Email provides free pre-built component primitives (`@react-email/components`): Html, Head, Body, Container, Section, Text, Button, Img, Link, Hr, Preview, Heading.

Cost for React Email: **$0** (open source).

#### DNS Setup Required

To send from `noreply@faineant.co`, add these DNS records (provided by Resend):

| Type | Name | Value | Purpose |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| TXT | faineant.co | `v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all` | SPF (sender auth) |
| CNAME | resend._domainkey.faineant.co | `[provided by Resend]` | DKIM (signing) |
| TXT | _dmarc.faineant.co | `v=DMARC1; p=none;` | DMARC (policy) |
| MX | send.faineant.co | `feedback-smtp.us-east-1.amazonses.com` | Bounce handling |

No Google Workspace seat needed for `noreply@faineant.co` — Resend handles sending directly.

#### Estimated Email Volume

## 10. Maps & Geolocation

Configured in `env.ts` (GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY) and `app.json` (iOS/Android keys).

| API | Free Tier | Cost After | Notes |
|-----|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Google Maps JavaScript API** | $200/mo credit (~28K loads) | $7/1000 loads | Web map display |

## 11. Mobile App Distribution

### Apple (iOS)

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Apple Developer Program** | **$99/yr** ($8.25/mo) | Required for App Store publishing |
| App Store commission | **15–30% of in-app purchases** | 15% for <$1M revenue (Small Business Program) |
| TestFlight | **$0** | Included, up to 10K testers |

### Google (Android)

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Google Play Console** | **$25 one-time** | Lifetime access |

| Free | **$0** | 30 builds/mo (low priority queue) |

Note: FAINEANT processes payments via Stripe (not IAP), so App Store/Play Store commissions likely don't apply to service bookings. Apple's rules may require 30% cut on digital goods — but real-world service bookings are typically exempt.

**Recommended:**
- Apple Developer: **$99/yr**
- Google Play: **$25 one-time**
- EAS Free tier initially, upgrade to Production ($99/mo) when shipping regularly

| **Intercom** | — | **$139/seat/mo** | Full-featured but expensive |
| **Zendesk** | — | **$55–115/agent/mo** | Enterprise-grade |

---

**Recommended: HubSpot Free @ $0/mo**

---

## 19. Compliance & Regulatory

### PCI DSS
FAINEANT uses Stripe.js client-side tokenization — card data never touches FAINEANT servers.
Qualifies for **SAQ-A** (simplest self-assessment). Cost: **$0** (fill out questionnaire annually).

### CCPA / State Privacy Laws
20+ states have privacy laws. If you have California users, CCPA applies.
- Requires: opt-out rights, data deletion, disclosure of practices
- Cost: **$0** if built into privacy policy from day 1. **$1,000–2,000** for lawyer review.

### ADA / WCAG Accessibility
**This is a real litigation risk.** 5,000+ digital accessibility lawsuits filed in 2025 (20% YoY increase). Settlements run $5,000–$75,000+. Marketplace booking flows are prime targets.
- Cost now: **$0** (build accessible components using semantic HTML, ARIA labels, color contrast)
- Cost if sued: **$5,000–$75,000+**
- Professional audit: **$5,000–$30,000**

**Build accessible from day one. Use axe-core or Lighthouse automated testing.**

### SOC 2 (Future)
Not needed at launch. Required for enterprise partnerships.
- Cost: **$8,000–$15,000/yr** via Vanta/Secureframe + auditor
- Timing: 12–24 months post-launch

### Cosmetology License Verification
Beauty providers must be licensed in their state. If FAINEANT lists an unlicensed provider and a client is harmed, FAINEANT faces liability.
- Minimum: Require providers to self-attest licensing in ToS (**$0**)
- Better: Integrate license verification API (LicenseLogix, Certn): **$5–10/verification**
- Timing: Self-attestation at launch, automated verification in Phase 2

---

## 20. Content Moderation

FAINEANT has user-generated content: reviews, community posts, comments, portfolio photos, profile images, messages. All need moderation.

| Approach | Cost | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Basic rules + admin review queue | **$0** | Admin panel already exists (`admin.routes.ts`) |
| AI text moderation (Claude API) | **$5–20/mo** | Already have `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in env |
| AI image moderation (AWS Rekognition) | **$1/1,000 images** | Flag NSFW/inappropriate portfolio photos |
| Manual moderation (contractor) | **$15–25/hr** | When volume exceeds what AI + admins can handle |

**Recommended: Admin review queue + Claude API for text @ $0–20/mo at launch**

---

## 21. Twilio 10DLC Registration (MANDATORY for SMS)

**Often overlooked.** Without A2P 10DLC registration, US carriers will filter/block your SMS messages.

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Brand registration | **$4.50–$46 one-time** | Depends on company size |
| Campaign registration | **$15/mo recurring** | Per campaign (e.g., "booking confirmations") |
| Carrier pass-through fees | **$0.003–$0.005/msg** | On top of Twilio's per-message fee |
| Registration timeline | **1–4 weeks** | Start before launch |

Without registration, your booking confirmation SMS will silently fail. Start this process during pre-launch.

---

## 22. Background Checks for Providers (Optional)

For providers who do mobile/at-home services (coming to client's home). Less critical for salon-only services.

| Provider | Cost per Check | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Checkr API** | **$30** | Basic criminal + identity |
| **Certn** | **$5–70** | Range of check depths |
| **GoodHire** | **$30–80** | Comprehensive packages |

Who pays: Most marketplaces charge the provider or split the cost.

**Recommended: Provider self-attestation at launch. Add background checks for at-home services in Phase 2.**

---

## 23. Accounting & Tax

### Bookkeeping Software

| Provider | Cost | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|

| State franchise tax (if DE LLC) | **$300/yr** | Delaware annual fee |
| State sales tax compliance | **$0–2,000/yr** | May apply to platform fees in some states |

**Recommended: Wave (free) at launch → QuickBooks ($30/mo) when revenue starts. CPA from year 1.**

---

## 24. Payroll (When Hiring)

| Provider | Base + Per Person | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| **Gusto** (recommended) | **$40/mo + $6/person** | US payroll, benefits, tax filing |
| **Rippling** | **$8/person/mo** (no base) | More features, higher complexity |
| **Deel** | **$49/contractor/mo** | International contractors |

**Not needed until first W-2 hire.** Use 1099 contractors initially (just pay via Mercury + file 1099s).

---

## 25. Insurance (Detailed)

A marketplace connecting strangers for physical services has real liability exposure.

| Type | Monthly Cost | Annual | When Needed |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| General Liability | **$30–60** | $360–720 | **At launch** |
| Professional Liability / E&O | **$50–100** | $600–1,200 | **At launch** |
| Cyber Liability | **$80–250** | $1,000–3,000 | At launch or within 3 months |
| D&O Insurance | **$300–500** | $3,500–6,000 | Before fundraising only |

Providers should carry their own professional liability insurance (cosmetology insurance). FAINEANT should **require** providers to maintain their own coverage and add this to provider terms.

**Recommended at launch: GL + E&O bundle via Hiscox or Next Insurance @ ~$100/mo ($1,200/yr)**

## Transaction Economics (Critical)

FAINEANT uses Stripe Connect with `application_fee_amount`. The current platform fee
is **5%** (`STRIPE_PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENT=5` in env). Here's how money actually flows:

### Per-Transaction Breakdown ($45 booking)

```
Client pays                         $45.00

Stripe processing fee (2.9% + $0.30)
  2.9% of $45.00 =  $1.31
  + flat fee      =  $0.30
  Total Stripe    = -$1.61

FAINEANT platform fee (5% of $45.00)    = -$2.25

Provider receives                   $41.14
```

**Key:** Stripe's 2.9% + $0.30 is deducted from the total charge first. FAINEANT's 5%
application fee is taken from what remains. The provider gets the rest.

### FAINEANT's Actual Revenue Per Transaction

| Booking Price | Stripe Fee (2.9%+$0.30) | FAINEANT Fee (5%) | FAINEANT Keeps | Provider Gets |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| $20 | $0.88 | $1.00 | **$1.00** | $18.12 |
| $35 | $1.32 | $1.75 | **$1.75** | $31.94 |
| $45 | $1.61 | $2.25 | **$2.25** | $41.14 |
| $50 | $1.75 | $2.50 | **$2.50** | $45.75 |
| $75 | $2.48 | $3.75 | **$3.75** | $68.78 |
| $100 | $3.20 | $5.00 | **$5.00** | $91.80 |
| $150 | $4.65 | $7.50 | **$7.50** | $137.85 |
| $200 | $6.10 | $10.00 | **$10.00** | $183.90 |

FAINEANT's effective take rate is **5% of GMV** regardless of Stripe fees.
Stripe fees are absorbed by the total (shared pain between FAINEANT and provider).

### Should You Raise the Platform Fee?

At 5%, FAINEANT earns $2.25 on a $45 booking. Industry comparisons:

| Platform | Take Rate | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| FAINEANT (current) | **5%** | Low, competitive |
| Booksy | 3–5% + subscription | $30/mo subscription to providers |
| StyleSeat | 25% on marketplace bookings | Very high, includes marketing |
| Fresha | 0% + payment fee (2.19%+$0.20) | Makes money on payments only |
| Vagaro | $0 platform fee + $25–85/mo subscription | Subscription model |
| Square Appointments | 2.6% + $0.10 | Payment processing only |

**Recommendation:** 5% is competitive for launch. Consider raising to **7–10%** once
you demonstrate value (booking volume, reduced no-shows, provider tools). Or add
a **premium tier** for providers at $15–30/mo with lower transaction fee (2–3%).

### Revenue vs Cost (Corrected with Real Stripe Math)

FAINEANT revenue = **5% of GMV** (the `application_fee_amount`).
Stripe fees are not deducted from FAINEANT's cut — they come from the total charge.

| Monthly GMV | Bookings (~$45 avg) | FAINEANT Revenue (5%) | All Costs | Net |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|-----|
| $5,000 | ~110 | $250 | $700 | **-$450** |
| $10,000 | ~222 | $500 | $700 | **-$200** |
| **$14,000** | **~311** | **$700** | **$700** | **$0 (break-even)** |
| $20,000 | ~444 | $1,000 | $750 | **+$250** |
| $35,000 | ~778 | $1,750 | $750 | **+$1,000** |
| $50,000 | ~1,111 | $2,500 | $800 | **+$1,700** |
| $100,000 | ~2,222 | $5,000 | $1,000 | **+$4,000** |
| $250,000 | ~5,556 | $12,500 | $1,500 | **+$11,000** |

"All Costs" = infra ($500) + insurance ($100) + CPA amortized ($170) + buffer.

**Break-even: ~$14,000/mo GMV** (~311 bookings/mo, ~10 bookings/day)

That's roughly **700–1,200 active users** booking 1–2 times per month.

### Additional Stripe Costs to Budget

Don't forget these transaction-adjacent costs:

| Item | Cost | When |
|------|------|------|
| Stripe processing (2.9%+$0.30) | ~$1.61 per $45 booking | Every transaction |
| Stripe Connect active account fee | $2/mo per active provider | Waived for <$1M volume |
| Disputes/chargebacks | $15 per dispute | Hopefully rare |
| Refunds | Stripe fee is NOT returned | You eat the $1.61 on refunds |
| Instant payouts (if offered) | 1% of payout amount | Optional for providers |
| Stripe Radar (fraud prevention) | $0.05/screened transaction | Recommended at scale |
| Stripe Tax (auto sales tax) | $0.50/transaction | Required in some states |

**Refund risk:** If a $45 booking is refunded, FAINEANT returns the full $45 to the client.
Stripe does NOT refund its $1.61 processing fee. FAINEANT loses $1.61 + its $2.25 fee = **$3.86 loss per refund.**
Budget for a ~2–5% refund/dispute rate at launch.

### Worst-Case Scenario: Refund-Adjusted Revenue

Assuming 3% refund rate:

| Monthly GMV | Bookings | Refunded (3%) | FAINEANT Gross (5%) | Refund Loss | FAINEANT Net Revenue |
|-------------|----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| $10,000 | 222 | 7 | $500 | -$27 | **$473** |
| $25,000 | 556 | 17 | $1,250 | -$66 | **$1,184** |
| $50,000 | 1,111 | 33 | $2,500 | -$127 | **$2,373** |

Refunds are a minor hit (~5% of revenue). The main risk is chargebacks ($15 each) —
deposit requirements and clear cancellation policies mitigate this.
