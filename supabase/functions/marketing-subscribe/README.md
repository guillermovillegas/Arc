# marketing-subscribe Edge Function

Owns the public homepage marketing-email opt-in and unsubscribe flow. It is
separate from `send-email`, which remains transactional.

## Required secrets

- `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `EMAIL_FROM_NAME` and `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`
- `WEB_URL` (canonical public site)
- `MARKETING_POSTAL_ADDRESS` (a valid physical postal address; never invent one)
- `MARKETING_SIGNING_SECRET` (at least 32 random bytes)
- `MARKETING_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (optional comma-separated preview/local origins)
- `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` (optional; when set, every subscribe must carry a
  solved Cloudflare Turnstile token. Pair it with `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`
  on the web app. Leave both unset to keep the previous behaviour.)

Supabase injects `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. The
service-role key never reaches the browser.

The function refuses to send a marketing email if the Resend key, postal
address, or signing secret is missing. Consent remains stored so a retry can
complete delivery after configuration is corrected.

## Controls

- Exact disclosure version, source, timestamp, referrer, user agent, and an HMAC
  of the request address are recorded.
- Legacy waitlist rows remain `legacy` and are not silently treated as consent.
- Anonymous table writes are revoked; only the Edge Function records consent.
- Thirty charged requests per HMAC-address per rolling hour are allowed. A
  request is charged only when it records consent or sends a welcome note.
  Re-submitting an address that is already subscribed and already welcomed is a
  no-op and costs nothing, so returning visitors and people sharing an office,
  campus, VPN or carrier NAT address are not told "Too many requests" for
  someone else's signups. Retrying a failed delivery stays charged, because the
  send is real.
- When `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` is set, an unsolved challenge is refused before
  any database read or write. The address budget remains a coarse flood stop;
  Turnstile is the control an `x-forwarded-for` rewrite cannot walk past.
- Known trade-off: because the no-op case is exempt, a saturated bucket answers
  200 for an address already on the list and 429 for one that is not. An
  attacker willing to spend the budget first can use that to test membership.
  Turnstile prices each probe and is the mitigation; provision it before
  treating list membership as confidential.
- Welcome sends use Resend idempotency keys.
- Human unsubscribe links lead to the branded site. `List-Unsubscribe` and
  `List-Unsubscribe-Post` support provider one-click unsubscribe requests.
- Withdrawn addresses remain on a suppression ledger and must be excluded from
  every future marketing campaign.

## Verification

```sh
deno check --node-modules-dir=auto supabase/functions/marketing-subscribe/index.ts
deno test --allow-env --node-modules-dir=auto supabase/functions/marketing-subscribe
```

Do not deploy until the Resend domain DNS is verified and the owner supplies the
valid physical postal address.
